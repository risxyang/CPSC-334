## Installation ##

Materials:
- 3 Projectors, with necessary HDMI cables. Run either with a Pi + Camera + Mic, or just from your Laptop (our preference).

Instructions:
- Download <a href="https://processing.org/download">Processing IDE</a>
- Clone this repo
- run Python script (python3 detect_humans.py) 
- Open any of [webcam_boil, webcam_listen, spotlights] within the IDE and run the program

2/3 of these projections (webcam listen, webcam boil) require you to run the detect_humans script. This script handles face and human body detection using haar-cascades.
